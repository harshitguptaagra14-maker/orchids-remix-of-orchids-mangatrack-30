## User & Authentication

### 1. Get User by ID
**Purpose**: Retrieve user profile with all fields for authenticated sessions.

FROM users
WHERE id = $1::uuid
  AND deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### 2. Check Username Availability
**Purpose**: Validate username uniqueness during registration/update.

```sql
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM users 
  WHERE LOWER(username) = LOWER($1::text)
    AND deleted_at IS NULL
) as exists;
```

### 3. Get User by Username (Public Profile)
**Purpose**: Fetch public profile data respecting privacy settings.

```sql

  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = $1::uuid
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
RETURNING *;
```

### 5. Login Attempt Rate Limiting
**Purpose**: Check and record login attempts for brute-force protection.

-- Check recent failures
SELECT COUNT(*) as attempt_count
FROM login_attempts
WHERE (email = $1::text OR ip_address = $2::text)
  AND success = false

## Analytics & Signals

### 37. Record User Signal
**Purpose**: Track user interaction for recommendations.

```sql
INSERT INTO user_signals (user_id, series_id, signal_type, weight, metadata)
VALUES ($1::uuid, $2::uuid, $3::text, $4::float, $5::jsonb);
```

### 38. Update User Affinity
**Purpose**: Adjust affinity scores based on signals.

```sql
INSERT INTO user_affinities (user_id, attribute_type, attribute_id, score)
VALUES ($1::uuid, $2::text, $3::text, $4::float)
ON CONFLICT (user_id, attribute_type, attribute_id)
DO UPDATE SET 
  score = user_affinities.score + EXCLUDED.score,
  last_updated_at = NOW();
```

### 39. Get User Affinity Profile
**Purpose**: Retrieve user's content preferences.

```sql
SELECT 
  attribute_type, attribute_id, score
FROM user_affinities
WHERE user_id = $1::uuid
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### 40. Record Read Telemetry
**Purpose**: Anti-cheat tracking (detection only).

```sql
INSERT INTO read_telemetry (
  user_id, series_id, chapter_number, 
  read_duration_s, page_count, device_id,
  flagged, flag_reason
)
VALUES (
  $1::uuid, $2::uuid, $3::int,
  $4::int, $5::int, $6::text,
  $7::boolean, $8::text
);
```

## Admin & Maintenance

### 41. Get Import Job Summary
**Purpose**: Aggregate import statistics.

```sql
SELECT 
  status,
  reason_code,
  COUNT(*) as item_count
FROM import_items
WHERE job_id = $1::uuid
GROUP BY status, reason_code
ORDER BY status ASC;
```

### 42. Get Pending Metadata Enrichment
**Purpose**: Find library entries needing metadata resolution.

```sql
SELECT 
  le.id, le.source_url, le.source_name, le.imported_title,
  le.metadata_retry_count, le.last_metadata_attempt_at
FROM library_entries le
WHERE le.metadata_status = 'pending'
  AND le.deleted_at IS NULL
  AND (
    le.last_metadata_attempt_at IS NULL 
    OR le.last_metadata_attempt_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
  )
  AND le.metadata_retry_count < 5
ORDER BY le.last_metadata_attempt_at ASC NULLS FIRST
LIMIT $1::int;
```

### 43. Get Series with Stale Sync
**Purpose**: Find sources needing chapter sync.

```sql
SELECT 
  ss.id, ss.series_id, ss.source_name, ss.source_url,
  ss.sync_priority, ss.next_check_at, ss.failure_count
FROM series_sources ss
WHERE ss.source_status = 'active'
  AND (ss.next_check_at IS NULL OR ss.next_check_at < NOW())
  AND ss.failure_count < 10
ORDER BY 
  CASE ss.sync_priority 
    WHEN 'HIGH' THEN 1 
    WHEN 'WARM' THEN 2 
    ELSE 3 
  END,
  ss.next_check_at ASC NULLS FIRST
LIMIT $1::int;
```

### 44. Record Worker Failure
**Purpose**: DLQ entry for failed jobs.

```sql
INSERT INTO worker_failures (
  queue_name, job_id, payload, 
  error_message, stack_trace, attempts_made
)
VALUES ($1::text, $2::text, $3::jsonb, $4::text, $5::text, $6::int)
RETURNING id;
```

### 45. Get DLQ Items for Retry
**Purpose**: Retrieve unresolved failures for retry.

```sql
SELECT 
  id, queue_name, job_id, payload,
  error_message, attempts_made, created_at
FROM worker_failures
WHERE resolved_at IS NULL
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT $1::int;
```

## Index Recommendations

### Critical Performance Indexes

```sql
-- Feed query optimization (primary bottleneck)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_feed_entries_series_discovered
ON feed_entries (series_id, first_discovered_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_feed_entries_logical_chapter
ON feed_entries (logical_chapter_id) WHERE logical_chapter_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Library join optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_library_entries_user_series_status
ON library_entries (user_id, series_id, status) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Read state lookups
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_user_chapter_reads_v2_user_chapter
ON user_chapter_reads_v2 (user_id, chapter_id);

-- Activity feed
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_activities_user_created
ON activities (user_id, created_at DESC);

-- Follow expansion
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_follows_follower_following
ON follows (follower_id, following_id);
```

## Query Parameterization Notes

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$1::uuid` | UUID | User ID (most common) |
| `$2::text` | Text | Search query, status filter |
| `$3::int` | Integer | Limit/pagination |
| `$4::int` | Integer | Offset |
| `$5::timestamptz` | Timestamp | Cursor for keyset pagination |
| `$N::jsonb` | JSONB | Metadata, settings objects |

All queries use parameterized values to prevent SQL injection.

---

## Soft Delete Convention

All queries respect the `deleted_at IS NULL` convention:

```sql
-- Always include in WHERE clauses:
WHERE table.deleted_at IS NULL

-- For JOINs with soft-deleted tables:
LEFT JOIN series s ON le.series_id = s.id AND s.deleted_at IS NULL
```

Tables with soft delete:
- `users`
- `series`
- `chapters`
- `library_entries`
