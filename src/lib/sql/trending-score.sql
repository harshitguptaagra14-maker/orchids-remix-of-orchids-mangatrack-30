-- Velocity-Based Trending Score Query
-- Measures rate-of-change in engagement, NOT absolute popularity
-- 
-- KEY DIFFERENCE FROM POPULARITY:
-- - Popularity = total follows, all-time views (favors established giants)
-- - Velocity = Δ follows, Δ chapters in 24-72h (favors current momentum)
--
-- VELOCITY FORMULA:
-- V_chapters = (chapters_24h * 2.0) + (chapters_72h * 0.5)
-- V_follows  = (follows_24h * 1.5) + (follows_72h * 0.3)
-- V_activity = (reads_24h * 1.0)
--
-- FINAL_SCORE = (V_chapters * 0.50 + V_follows * 0.35 + V_activity * 0.15) * RECENCY_FACTOR
--
-- RECENCY_FACTOR = 1 / (1 + days_since_last_chapter_event)
--
-- RULES:
-- - Tier A only (actively maintained catalog)
-- - Dead manga excluded (no chapters in 90+ days)
-- - Must have activity in 72h window to appear

-- Velocity-based trending (default)
