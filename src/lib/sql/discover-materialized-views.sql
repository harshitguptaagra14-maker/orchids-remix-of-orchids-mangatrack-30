-- REFRESH STRATEGY (to be called via pg_cron or external scheduler)
-- ============================================================

-- Concurrent refresh prevents table locking during refresh
-- Requires UNIQUE index on materialized view

-- REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY discover_trending;      -- Every 10 min
-- REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY discover_popular_30d;   -- Every 1 hour
-- REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY discover_recently_active; -- Every 10 min
-- REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY discover_highest_rated; -- Every 24 hours
-- REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY discover_new_and_noteworthy; -- Every 1 hour


-- ============================================================
-- USAGE EXAMPLES
-- ============================================================

-- Get top 20 trending series:
-- SELECT * FROM discover_trending WHERE rank <= 20 ORDER BY rank;

-- Get popular series with genre filter:
-- SELECT * FROM discover_popular_30d WHERE 'Action' = ANY(genres) ORDER BY rank LIMIT 20;

-- Get recently active series:
-- SELECT * FROM discover_recently_active ORDER BY rank LIMIT 20;

-- Get highest rated series:
-- SELECT * FROM discover_highest_rated ORDER BY rank LIMIT 20;

-- Get new releases:
-- SELECT * FROM discover_new_and_noteworthy ORDER BY rank LIMIT 20;
